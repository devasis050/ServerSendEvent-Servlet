# ServerSendEvent-Servlet

This is a sample app with servlet. This is just to understand basic working of server sent event. 
In real time we will use either Spring Web Flux or web socket. 

Things not taken care 
1) Client cors error. Working in browser currently.
2) Not effor has been put to understand AsyncContext. 
3) This app is not asynchronous.
